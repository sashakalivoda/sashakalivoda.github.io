<p>I'm Sasha, a data analyst and aspiring data scientist passionate in learning about what the world can teach us through data. I am constantly learning how to be a better data scientist; whether learning technical skills in Python, R, and SQL or becoming a better communicator with data through visualization tools like Tableau or perfecting the art of storytelling.</p>
